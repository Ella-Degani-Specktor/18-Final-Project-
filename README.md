# Final Project
Telecom operator Interconnect would like to forecast their churn of clients. If it's discovered that a user is planning to leave, they'll be offered promotional codes and special plan options. Interconnect's marketing team has collected some of their clientele's personal data, including information about their plans and contracts.
The project is to develop a binary classification model to predict whether a client will leave the company soon based on the clientele's personal data, including information about their plans and contracts.
